## Objective :
The dataset contained records exported from MavenTech's CRM from October 2016 to December 2017. It held details of opportunities with associated information such as product, account, and whether the sale was won or lost.

## Data Source :
Dataset source : [CRM Sales Dataset](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=crm)

## Steps Involved :
1. **Data Import and Integration** :
- Imported multiple datasets from the MavenTech CRM into Power Query in PowerBI.
- Explored each dataset to understand its structure, data types, and relationships between different datasets.
- Established connections between datasets using PowerBI’s relationship feature to create a unified data model.
2. **Data Cleaning** :
- Identified and handled missing values through imputation or exclusion.
- Standardized text data by ensuring consistent formatting (e.g., case consistency, removal of extra spaces).
3. **Data Transformation** :
- This included creating calculated columns and measures using Power Query and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
4. **Data Standardization** :
- Ensured numerical data were in consistent units and formats across all datasets.
- Standardized date formats and ensured consistency in timestamps.
5. **Data Analysis** :
- Conducted descriptive statistics to summarize the data, such as calculating averages, totals, and distributions.
- Used Power Query and DAX functions to perform more advanced calculations and aggregations.
- Applied filters and slicers to dynamically explore the data and uncover patterns and trends.
6. **Visualization and Dashboarding** :
- Created various visualizations including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and maps to represent key metrics and trends.
- Developed interactive dashboards, incorporating features like slicers, and tooltips to enable dynamic data exploration.
- Ensured that visualizations were clear, informative, and visually appealing.

## Skills Acquired :
- Proficiency in data cleaning and transformation using Power Query in PowerBI.
- Ability to standardize and integrate multiple datasets from the MavenTech CRM.
- Advanced DAX functions and PowerBI features for data manipulation.
- Creation of interactive and compelling visualizations and dashboards.

## Outcome:
The project significantly enhanced my ability to work with complex datasets in Power Query and PowerBI, transforming raw data into meaningful insights. I am now more confident in handling real-world data analysis tasks, leveraging Power Query and PowerBI’s powerful features for effective data visualization and reporting.
